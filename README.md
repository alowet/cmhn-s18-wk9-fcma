Feedback:

Ex 6: 'all_top' refers to the concatenated leave-one-out masks. In other words, each mask that is generated by the voxel selection (not the intermediate masks, the final mask based on the cross validation accuracy scores) when leaving out a participant is stored in this file.  
Ex 8: Your plotting the top 1000 voxels.  
Ex 10: You only ran this on 17 participants, not 18.
